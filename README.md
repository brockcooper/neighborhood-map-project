# Neighborhood Map Project

This project was made by integrating the Google Maps, Google Places, and Foursquare APIs to create a mashup project. You should be able to search any topic and see the results for Google Places and Foursqaure on the map and on a sidebar displaying the results. This project uses the Knockout.js framework.

### Expected Results

You should be able to search in the search bar and see both Google Places and Foursqaure results appear on the page. Foursqaure data will have the Foursqaure icon and Google Places will have individual icons based on the type of place. 

Results will also appear in the sidebar. You can click on the icons in the sidebar for the Google Maps InfoWindow toopen on the map.
